# Meta-analysis weighted by standard error does not work well
# when different studies used very different transformations
# If we wanted to use inverse variance weights, we would un-comment
# the next line:
# SCHEME   STDERR
# Not sure if genomic control is a good idea, given the large
# number of true associations in these three regions.  If we were doing
# a GWAS, and wanted to estimate genomic control lambda from the analysis,
# and then adjust each study by its genomic control lambda, 
# we would uncomment this line:
# GENOMICCONTROL ON
# Note in this example, we instead set the genomic control lambda for each 
# study (based on the published GWAS), rather than estimating it from our
# data.  These data are not genome-wide, so we can't estimate the lambda
# from the test statistics 
# To help identify allele flips, it can be useful to track
# allele frequencies in the meta-analysis.  To do that, we can
# uncomment the next two lines:
# AVERAGEFREQ ON
# MINMAXFREQ ON
